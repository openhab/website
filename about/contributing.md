openHAB is a community effort and everyone can take part in that.
Be it by being an active developer, a bug reporter, a writer or translator, or making monetary contributions, here's an overview on how you can get involved!

More people will see your issue when it is posted in the forum and community members may be able to help you find known solutions/workarounds.
