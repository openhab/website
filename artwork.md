## Our Logo

Our logo is our most recognizable asset. We therefore ask you to respect our [trademark policy](/about/trademark) when you reuse it - please read through it in detail and do not hesitate to [reach out to us](/about/trademark#contact) in case of any doubts.

We provide different versions of our logo, e.g. with or without the "openHAB" text, a vertical and a horizontal version as well as versions for light and dark backgrounds.

The logos are provided in different formats like svg, eps, ai and png. Whereever possible, please prefer the vector formats over png to avoid pixelation.
